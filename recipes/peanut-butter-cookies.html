    <p>My dad's sister gave me this recipe for killer peanut butter cookies made with shortening.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup shortening</li>
    <li>½ cup crunchy peanut butter</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cream shortening, peanut butter, and both sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
        Beat in egg until incorporated. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl; 
        gradually stir into peanut butter mixture until combined. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour.
        </li>     
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>
        Roll chilled dough into walnut-sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto baking sheets. 
        Flatten dough balls with a fork dipped in flour to form a crosswise pattern.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
    </li>
</ol>
