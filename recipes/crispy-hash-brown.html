    <p>Good, old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns. Perfect with hot pepper sauce and ketchup!
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
    <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>  
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.
        </li>     
    <li>
        Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.
    </li>
    <li>
        Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer.
         Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. 
        If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve hot and enjoy!
